# PyData Khartoum

## About PyData Organization
NumFOCUS is the organizer of PyData. NumFOCUS is a nonprofit organization whose aim is to promote the use of accessible and reproducible computing in science and technology. ^[1]

Data science is ever increasing skill to have, though not _all_ people have access to it. Most of the materials are indeed available for free online, sometimes it is the language that makes this barrier. We meant to remove this barrier and others. The idea of _physical_ meetings have proven to be very useful. For one, you get to meet people with whom you share the same passion. We want people from all backgrounds, level expertise to come and share their data science skills. _We are still not officially PyData registered organization, we will be a one very soon_.

## Meetings
We intend to make a monthly meetings. Since, we believe our community needs tutorials more than showcases, e.g., a tutorial in numpy would be more useful than the use of data science in natural language processing. It is our intention to focus first on these beginners tutorials on various data science tools. That doesn't mean we won't actually feature other tutorials alongside the tutorials, we will gradually rollout data science applications sessions.

## Membership
We don't think of any membership model. If you have any suggestions on this regard, give us a shot.
Sessions will mostly be on monthly bases. We shall inform both the speakers as well as the audience before the meeting day.


## Code of Conduct
While we still didn't develop our own code of conduct, we have inherited PyData general code of conduct. We believe it to be good enough to suit our case.

PyData is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for PyData.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.
