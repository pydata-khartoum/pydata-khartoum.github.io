# PyData Khartoum
PyData Khartoum is meeting group to study and learn data science using open source tools. PyData has different branches covering many countries in the world. We wanted to have a branch too. The meetings are mostly organized by Reem Omer (all hail Reem!) with a bit help from Mohamed Yousif and her friend Tagwa.

## What we do
- Monthly meetings where invited speakers show how they use Python and other tools in doing data science projects.
- Tutorial to help newcomers get into the field of Python and data science.

## Sponsors
We are very thankful to Innovation Platform for their unlimited support by allowing us to use their offices and rooms to do the meetings. Another support is also provided by GNDI (they offer a hall to host some of the meetings.) Most of all, we are really thankful for Reem and her huge support to connect all of these people together! It was very hard to get that. We are grateful for our speakers as they allocating some of their time to help others!
